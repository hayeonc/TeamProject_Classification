    "> ### The activity file contains several different categories of activities. \n",
    ">> Type 1 activities are different from type 2-7 activities because there are more known characteristics associated with type 1 activities (nine in total) than type 2-7 activities (which have only one associated characteristic).\n",
    "> ### To develop a predictive model with this data, you will likely need to join the files together into a single data set. The two files can be joined together using person_id as the common key. All variables are categorical, with the exception of 'char_38' in the people file, which is a continuous numerical variable.\n",
